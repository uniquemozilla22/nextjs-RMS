This application is created by practising the server-side rendering of Next JS which is built with
NextJS at the front end and Firebase housing its backend and for the data store, it is using
firestorm by Google. This application is a simple chat application where the user can create a
chat with any user with an email by tapping on the “ START A NEW CHAT “ button on the
sidebar.

Simply click on “Chat with new user” Button on the sidebar a prompt will pop asking you to enter
the email you will like to chat with. You just have to enter the email of the user and the
application will create a chatroom with the given user’s email. However the application will only
show the active status when the user already has registered to the application. Email
Verification is handled so the email the user inputs will be validated.

All the other features are just like whats app where you can send and receive the messages.
